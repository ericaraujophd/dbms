# What is Relational?

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. It organizes data into tables, which consist of rows and columns, making it easy to identify and access data in relation to other data in the database. This structure is based on the relational model proposed by E.F. Codd in 1970.

## Key Characteristics of Relational Databases

- **Data Organization**: Data is stored in tables (relations) with rows (records) and columns (fields).
- **Schema-Based**: Each table has a predefined schema that defines the structure and constraints of the data.
- **Relationships**: Tables can be linked using keys (primary and foreign keys) to represent relationships between data.
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to interact with relational databases for querying, updating, and managing data.

## Advantages of Relational Databases

- **Data Integrity**: Ensures accuracy and consistency of data through constraints and relationships.
- **Flexibility**: Allows complex queries and data manipulation using SQL.
- **Scalability**: Supports large datasets and concurrent users efficiently.
- **Security**: Provides robust mechanisms to control access and protect data.

## Applications of Relational Databases

Relational databases are widely used in various industries, including:

- **Finance**: For managing transactions, customer data, and financial records.
- **Healthcare**: To store patient records, appointments, and medical histories.
- **E-commerce**: For inventory management, customer orders, and payment processing.
- **Education**: To manage student records, courses, and grades.
