For this task, you are given a set of csv files that contain information about the [**Animal Crossing New Horizons Catalog**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nookplaza-dataset/data), a popular video game.\n",

The data was collected by a dedicated group of AC fans who continue to collaborate and build this spreadsheet for public use. The database contains the original data and full list of contributors and raw data. At the time of writing, the only difference between the spreadsheet and this version is that the Kaggle version omits all columns with images of the items, but is otherwise identical."
