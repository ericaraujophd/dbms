## Initial Instructions

Welcome to the second week of the course! This week, we will focus on working with multiple tables in SQL. We will learn how to join tables, use subqueries, and perform advanced data retrieval operations.

This week is crucial for understanding how to work with relational databases, as most real-world applications involve multiple tables that need to be queried together.
