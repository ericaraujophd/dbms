# Class 1. Indexes and Performance

This class will cover the topic of **indexes** and performance in SQL. Indexes are data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. They can significantly enhance query performance, especially for large datasets.

Indexes are created on one or more columns of a table and allow the database engine to quickly locate rows that match specific criteria. This can lead to faster query execution times and improved overall performance.

Indexes can be created using the `CREATE INDEX` command, and they can be managed using various performance and debug commands, such as `ANALYZE` and `EXPLAIN`. These commands help analyze query performance and provide insights into how the database engine executes queries.

In this class, we will explore how to create and manage indexes effectively, as well as how to use performance and debug commands to optimize query performance. We will also discuss the importance of database design principles and how they can impact performance.
