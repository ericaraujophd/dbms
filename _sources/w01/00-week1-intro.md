# Week 1 - Relational Model, SQL and more

## Initial Instructions

This week will mark the beginning of our journey into the world of databases, specifically focusing on relational databases and SQL (Structured Query Language). This course is meant to cover the basics of database management systems (DBMS) and SQL, providing you with the foundational knowledge and skills necessary to work with databases effectively.

Our course will be hands-on, and you will be expected to write SQL queries, design database schemas, and understand the principles of database management. By the end of this week, you should have a solid understanding of what relational databases are, why they are important, and how to interact with them using SQL.

## Tools and methodology

This course will be given using SQLite and Jupyter Notebooks. SQLite is a lightweight, serverless database engine that is easy to set up and use. Jupyter Notebooks provide an interactive environment for writing and executing SQL queries, making it an ideal tool for learning and practicing SQL.

In a first moment we will work writing SQL queries to retrieve data and perform basic operations on the database. As the course progresses, we will migrate to Python as the main programming language for database interaction. Python is a powerful and versatile language that is widely used in data science and web development, making it an excellent choice for working with databases.

## Week 1 Assignments

This week requires you to complete the following tasks:

1. **Read the course syllabus**: Familiarize yourself with the course structure, grading policy, and important dates.
2. **Set up your environment**: Install SQLite and Jupyter Notebook on your computer. If you are using a cloud-based solution, ensure you have access to the necessary tools.
3. **Read** the following material available in the Hekman Library system: *Mark Simon. (2023). Getting Started with SQL and Databasesâ€¯: Managing and Manipulating Data with SQL. Apress. - Chapters 1, 2 and 3*
4. Complete **Homework 1**: *SQL Basics*.
5. Complete **Project 1**: *Database Design*.
6. Show up for **classes** on MWF from 2.45 PM to 3.50 PM.
