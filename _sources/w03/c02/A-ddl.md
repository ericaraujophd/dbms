# Class 2. DDL: introduction and commands

DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL used to define and manage database structures, such as tables, indexes, and schemas. DDL commands are responsible for creating, altering, and deleting database objects.

DDL commands include:

- **CREATE**: Used to create new database objects, such as tables, indexes, and views.
- **ALTER**: Used to modify existing database objects, such as adding or dropping columns in a table.
- **DROP**: Used to delete existing database objects, such as tables, indexes, and views.
- **RENAME COLUMN**: Used to rename existing database objects, such as tables or columns.
- **TRUNCATE**: Used to remove all rows from a table without deleting the table itself.

The DDL commands can have as targets the following objects:

- **TABLE**: A collection of related data organized in rows and columns.
- **INDEX**: A data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table.
- **VIEW**: A virtual table that is based on the result of a query. It can be used to simplify complex queries or to provide a specific view of the data.
- **SCHEMA**: A logical container for database objects, such as tables, indexes, and views. It helps organize and manage the database structure.
- **CONSTRAINT**: A rule that restricts the values that can be stored in a table. Constraints can be used to enforce data integrity and ensure that the data meets specific requirements.

In this class we will navigate on how to use the DDL commands efficiently.
